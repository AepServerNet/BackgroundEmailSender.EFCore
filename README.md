# BackgroundEmailSender-Test
Unfinished project, still under development and code optimization

## Attention
At the moment it occurs in the build phase the error is found here -> https://github.com/AngeloDotNet/BackgroundEmailSender-Test/blob/master/Startup.cs#L28

Error encountered while debugging with Visual Studio Code:
>Si Ã¨ verificata un'eccezione: CLR/System.InvalidOperationException
Eccezione non gestita di tipo 'System.InvalidOperationException' in System.Private.CoreLib.dll: 'Cannot consume scoped service 'System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1[Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostedService]' from singleton 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.HostedServiceExecutor'.'

Also, starting the application with the dotnet run command sends email only when it starts and no further process of managing the email queue is performed in the background.
